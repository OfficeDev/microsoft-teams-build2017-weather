# microsoft-teams-build2017-weather

This project is intended to be merged with a project created by the Microsoft Teams App Generator (https://www.npmjs.com/package/generator-teams).

This project was inspired by, and ported to TypeScript from, the [WeatherBuddy project](https://github.com/ispeakcomputer/weather_webapp_javascript) created by [Ryan (aka ispeakcomputer)](https://github.com/ispeakcomputer). 

The WeatherBuddy project, in turn, relies on the [OpenWeatherMap Font project](http://websygen.github.io/owfont/), which is also embedded in this project.
